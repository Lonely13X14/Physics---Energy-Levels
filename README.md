# Physics---Energy-Levels

A fun little school assignment to find energy values of a particle in a 1D box in various energy states. 
E(n) = (n^2 * h^2)/(8 * m * l^2) Where n is the number of energy state, 1 being ground state. 
Others are simply called excited states. 
h is planck's constant which is approximately 6.626e-34. 
m is mass of the particle in kg, while l is the length or dimension of the system.

I gave 2 exe files, 1 with system(pause) at end so as to not close the prompt immediately, use it if you can't use cmd prompt or vscode.

Thanks byeeee
